# CTEX-to-jpg-Godot-Script
Use this simple script to turn any .ctex file into a jpg 
Paste the ctex and its relevant import file in the .import folder and run it, it should give u the converted pictures int the exporter_ctex_to_png folder, thats it!
This will prolly only help data minders or APK molesters, literally made this for my convenience...
